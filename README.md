## Task 1: Track Workout

Effective workout tracking is integral to our fitness application, catering to all of our user groups. Task 1 enables users to meticulously record their workout sessions, including exercise names, repetitions, weight or resistance used, and sets performed, ensuring accuracy and reliability. It empowers users to delve into their workout history, accommodating various exercise styles and facilitating goal tracking through visualizing progress. Users initiate workouts by tracking start times, entering exercise details, and keeping track of rest and workout time. Upon workout completion, they record the end date and total elapsed time, creating a comprehensive fitness journey log.

## Task 2: Track Body Composition

This feature provides users with the ability to track metrics for their body measurements, which range from weight, chest size, bicep size, hip size, and waist size. It will allow them to visualize their progress over time and give them a better understanding of how to reach their goals. Due to its ease of access and intuitive nature, this feature will keep users more motivated to track their body measurements and overall stay consistent with the gym. Overall, this feature will enhance users' awareness of their body composition changes, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding their fitness routines and diets.

## Task 3: Notifications/Reminders

Incorporating reminders is a crucial feature of our application, designed with the diverse needs of our user base in mind. This functionality empowers users to effortlessly stay on top of their upcoming commitments, whether they pertain to workout routines or any other aspects of their daily lives. Our intuitive reminder system allows users to personalize their notifications by specifying a reminder's name, the desired time for the notification, and its recurrence pattern, such as weekly on Mondays and more.

## Task 4: View and Manage History

History is a feature that allows for viewing workout history. The feature is more geared towards lifters with more experience, however, any user should use it as it would help them make improvements faster. View and Manage History serves to allow users to review each week's workouts so that they can make improvements to their next week's workout.

## Task 5: User Goal Tracking

Effective user goal tracking is vital for fitness journeys, especially for beginners. This task aims to help users consolidate their physical activity goals, review past achievements, and set new goals.
